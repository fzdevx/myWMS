The software is a JEE architecture running on WildFly Application Server.\r\n\r\nI have clients running this software in their businesses.  We realised that the original software needed  \r\nsome new features and a number of bug fixes.  I also plan on a complete overhaul of the desktop software.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to use this software or find it useful in another project, please get in touch.\r\n",
