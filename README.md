# myWMS
A branch of myWMS Warehouse Management System as published by https://sourceforge.net/projects/mywmslos/ and http://www.mywms.org/

myWMS is a professional open source Warehouse Management System WMS under GPL. 
It is running in industrial environments and supports all basic processes. 
It runs on mobile terminals and works with Barcodes. The software is a JEE architecture running on WildFly Application Server.

I have clients running this software in their businesses.  We realised that the original software needed  
some new features and a number of bug fixes.  I also plan on a complete overhaul of the desktop software.

If you plan to use this software or find it useful in another project, please get in touch.
